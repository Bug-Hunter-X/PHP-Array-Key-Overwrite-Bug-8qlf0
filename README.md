# PHP Array Key Overwrite Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP involving the unintentional overwriting of array keys, specifically when using non-numeric keys. The `bug.php` file contains code that exemplifies this problem.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from a misunderstanding of how PHP handles associative arrays and key assignments, potentially leading to unexpected program behavior and difficult-to-debug issues. This example aims to highlight this pitfall and offer a solution for improved code robustness.
