This improved version uses array_merge to add new data without overwriting existing keys. It ensures that the original key-value pairs are preserved, maintaining data integrity.

```php
<?php
$myArray = [
    "apple" => "red",
    "banana" => "yellow"
];

$newData = [
    "banana" => "green", // Trying to update existing key
    "orange" => "orange"  // Adding a new key
];

$myArray = array_merge($myArray, $newData);

// Print the array to verify the result
print_r($myArray);
?>
```
This approach avoids potential data loss and key conflicts, leading to a more reliable and predictable outcome.
